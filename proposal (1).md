# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

TODO
PvZ

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

TODO
We want to just want recreate a childhood game. We are still iffy on this idea so we may change it up.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

TODO
The software will be pretty similar to PvZ. Some things we may add could be some new enemies and plants possibly relating to modern pop culture references and stuff like that. We still unsure of how it will be executed but we will figure it out.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable
N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable
Ashif Sunny is going to be my project partner

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

TODO
I will complete the project no matter what.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

TODO
For a better outcome I want to add uniqueness to the game.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

TODO
The best outcome will be a whole new look to the game based on maybe modern day pop culture references.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

TODO
We'll choose a game framework like Unity or Pygame and learn relevant skills like game loops, sprite handling, and animations. We'll also design new plants, zombies, and sound effects while studying Plants vs. Zombies mechanics and modern gaming trends. We will focus on game mechanics, asset creation, sound design, and level design.
